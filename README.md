🏥 General Healthcare Analytics
📌 Overview:

This project explores a healthcare dataset to discover meaningful insights about patients, doctors, hospitals, diagnoses, costs, and satisfaction levels.
It focuses on understanding key trends such as how treatment costs vary by diagnosis, which doctors receive the highest satisfaction ratings, and how insurance coverage impacts total medical expenses.
The goal is to turn raw healthcare data into clear visual insights that could help hospitals and healthcare teams improve both patient outcomes and cost efficiency.

📊 Dataset Information:

The dataset includes 600 patient records with details related to hospital visits, treatments, and satisfaction scores.
